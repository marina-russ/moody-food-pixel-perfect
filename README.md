# ‚≠ê Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>

Create a 'pixel-perfect' website based off of a .psd file with no additional information from a client.

This demonstrates the ability to correctly implement a design as well as attention to detail. Instead of creating a vague approximation of the design, the design is brought to life on the page as closely as code will allow.

I went out of my way to find a design that was not the most web-friendly in order to really challenge myself.

# üìê Process <a name="process"></a>

I started by using Adobe Photoshop to examine the .psd file and collect all the relevant spec information that I needed. Before jumping straight into the HTML, I took a moment to determine semantic elements (such as which headers should be h1, h2, h3, etc) and made an initial list of classes I knew would be needed. Then I typed up all of the text for the page, adding new classes as appropriate. Before I can be distracted by visuals I loaded the HTML file and checked the text for any typos. At that point I was able to start tackling the aesthetics of the page! Because of how blocky this design is, I decided to code the CSS section-by-section. Once all the CSS was done I compared the web page to the design comp file to check for any errors.

## Gathering Information

1. I checked the canvas size to determine that the static design layout is 1440 pixels wide.
2. I inspected all image and 'design' layers to determine the height and width of all graphic elements.
3. I extracted all the images as .png files via `Export -> Layers to Files`.
4. I inspected all text elements to determine font style, size, weight, and tracking.
5. I used the Eyedropper tool to gather all the necessary hex color codes.
6. I utilized the Ruler tool to determine the margins and padding for various elements.

# üöÄ Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

The "What's new?" section directly underneath the hero image was a little tricky. 
* I had never done vertical and horizontal text in the same section before. I solved that issue for the decorative vertical text by using `transform: rotate(270deg);` and then `position: relative` to place it where I wanted it. 
* The decorative yellow box background was also smaller than the section of text on that area of the page. I used `background: linear-gradient` with the top and bottom parts at zero opacity in order fill only part of the `<div>` with a colored background.
* For the list of items underneath the header, there was a large gap between the pipebar and the text. I couldn't just throw in a `margin-left` on the text elements because when an item goes on multiple lines the additional lines of text line up with the pipebar. I ended up using the `:before` pseudoclass to add the pipebar and leading gap. The `:before` element wouldn't allow for a string that ended in multiple spaces `"|    "` however, so I hardcoded the spaces in via Unicode characters: `content: "\007C \00a0 \00a0 \00a0";`

Another tricky part of the design was in the "Our New Menu" section with the partially transparent image background. 
* If I were to just slap on `opacity: 0.4;` then all the child elements would also be affected. My solution was to add a `linear-gradient` of black at 40% opacity to the background image.
* One change I did have to make to the design was the bright yellow bar where the prices were listed. The design comp shows it as semi-transparent when it is just over the background image and not the orange block. If the design were more CSS Grid friendly I perhaps would have tried to break it into two separate grid boxes (that appeared to be just one) with separate levels of opacity. However, I was already using CSS Grid to line up the menu items, descriptions, and food prices; the break needed to make the yellow bar two separate elements didn't line up with what was needed for the menu items. Almost no design is ever truly 'pixel-perfect' (CSS `line-height` works differently from the typesetting method used by most design software, different browsers can display the same page slightly different, etc.) so I determined that keeping the entire bar 100% opaque did not detract from the overall design intent.

## Future Development

I added some `:hover` effects to the nav bar, and would like to add them to the rest of the links and buttons on the page to help indicate to the user which parts of the page are interactable.
