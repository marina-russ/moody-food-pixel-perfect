# Purpose

Create a pixel-perfect website based off of a .psd file with no additional information from 'client'.

## Gathering Information

1. I checked the canvas size to determine that the design layout is 1440 pixels wide. 
2. I inspected all image and 'design' layers to determine the height and width of all graphic elements.
3. I  hid all non-image layers and extracted all the images as .png files via `Export -> Layers to Files`.
4. I inspected all text elements to determine font style, size, weight, and tracking. 
5. I used the eyedropper tool to gather all the necessary hex color codes.
6. I utilized the Ruler tool to determine the margins and padding for various elements.
