## Purpose

I believe this design comp was created by someone who speaks English as a second language, as I found what I believe to be several typos in the design comp. 

If this were a real project, I would have sent the designer an email with all of the text changes I was making to ensure that they all are indeed typos. In today's era where companies can use words like **"Kwik"** and language can change rapidly, it's theoretically possible that Moody Food's chefs called themselves Shefs. 

I would fix the typos I noticed but send an email to the designer notifying them of the changes. This way, the project is not slowed down or held up by a few hours or a day while waiting to hear back from the designer but if I made any errors in what I considered to be a typo the designer has an opportunity to inform me.

My email would probably look something like this:

**Subject: Potential Typos in Moody Food Design**

Hello, (Designer)!

I'm working on the Moody Food main page and came across a few typos that I fixed:

- What new? -> What's New?
- Shef -> Chef
- Ethic -> Ethics
- ask as -> ask us
- iteam -> item
- www.#pizzeriva.com -> www.#pizzeria.com

I also noticed a few small inconsistencies that I corrected: 
- One of the navbar items was typed as "About us". I capitalized "Us" for consistent navbar capitalization.
- I'm assuming that the final `#pizzeria.` at the bottom of the page with the social media links should have a lighter font weight applied to the hashtag so that it is consistent with the other instances of `#pizzeria.` on the page.
- In the footer, I'm assuming that the links in the final CONTACT column should be bold to match the other MENU and CHEF columns.

If you have no issues with any of these changes, you don't have to reply back to this email. 

If I mistakenly assumed something was a typo or an item is intentionally not consistent with other items, just let me know and I'll undo the change!

Thanks,<br>
